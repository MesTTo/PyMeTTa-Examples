"""Purpose: examples/ch09-types/09-recursive_types.metta in Python: one name, two arrows.

A blacksmith turns Metal into a Sword, and also into a Paperclip. Both arrows
are declared for the one name, so every question about the name answers twice,
and an application answers the results of both. Nothing here is a function
definition: there is no equation for `blacksmith` at all, only what its type
says, which is why the declarations are written as the facts they are.

The last claim is the one worth reading twice. `(iron blacksmith)` is not an
application, it is a two-element expression, so its type is the expression of
its parts' types, elementwise, and it answers once per arrow the second element
has.

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire. A PLACEHOLDER: the wave's
