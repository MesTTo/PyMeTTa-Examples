"""Purpose: examples/spaces/matchnested2.metta in Python: the join, not the nesting.

The same four friendships and the same two chains as matchnested.py, asked for
in one question instead of two: `(, (friend $1 $2) (friend $2 $3))` is a
conjunction, and the comma inside a subscript is Python's own spelling of it,
`m[S.friend(V.a, V.b), S.friend(V.b, V.c)]`.

So the pair of examples reads in Python exactly as it reads in MeTTa: nested
`for` loops there, one join here, the same answers either way. A join answers
each solution once, with all three names bound, which is why this file's body
is a single loop with no inner query in it.

`sorted(atoms)` is `msort`: atoms carry the engine's own elementwise order.

#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.

#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 2948 to 2953, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive

#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
