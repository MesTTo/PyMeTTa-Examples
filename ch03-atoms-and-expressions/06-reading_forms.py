"""Purpose: examples/ch03-atoms-and-expressions/06-reading_forms.metta in Python: still typing, or wrong?

This is the example where s-expression text is the SUBJECT rather than the
spelling. `parse-command` reads text and answers `(complete $term)`,
`incomplete`, or refuses; the text it reads is a datum, so it is written the
way the original writes it, marked `ground(...)` so that reading this file
says which strings are data and which would have been programs. The expected
terms are built at the `S.` door, because a twin may not reach the engine
through `parse` either.

Every refusal here is where Python's own vocabulary takes over. One bracket too
many cannot be repaired by more typing, so the reader refuses, and a refusal
crosses into Python as an EXCEPTION rather than as an atom: the original's
`(if-error (catch ...) Error NoError)` is a try/except here. The `lib_he`
import remains because its equations are observable stored content.
`EngineError` arrives from the errors satellite.
Guarantees: the library import preserves the example's stored definitions
[tested: examples/ch03-atoms-and-expressions/06-reading_forms.metta; commit=90ba93eb8f6e98ebfefc55416859bf13de6a8427].

The round trip through `sread` compares MeTTa TEXT, so it goes through the
engine's own `repr` and a `ground(...)` on both sides; Python's `repr` would
answer the host's spelling of the atom, which is a different claim.

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-25, 39083 to 39078 (-5), the registration refusal kind
#: makes the (vocabulary refusal-kind ...) catalog row fifteen members long
#: instead of fourteen, which moves it from storage arity 17 to 18, where the
#: Python seat's (vocabulary door-answers ...) already sits, so &metta keeps
#: one storage arity fewer and each open-tail catalog lookup,
#: metta_catalog_clause/2 visiting every arity, costs five inferences less; and
#: metta_host_signal_message//2 is one more predicate the engine module
#: defines, which every walk over the engine's predicates pays: filereader's
#: existing_predicate_arities/2 two inferences a registration of more than
#: twelve names, each restricted space's core 29, and 11-reference_rows' walk
#: 240, each reproduced exactly by one inert predicate added to the engine on

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-25, 39078 to 39857 (+779), the host evaluation door
#: replaces the Python binding's own evaluation, and its moves are these, each
#: measured on the superproject's dd36742f5 against the registration change
#: beneath it: every answer reads its well-founded residue through
#: call_delays/2, three inferences an answer; a flat call of a compiled
#: function is translated the first time it is asked, a translation-cache miss
#: the binding's direct call skipped; the gate that direct call ran on every
#: ask, a type-declaration match through the space's storage, the foreign-space
#: hook and the MORK ownership question, is gone; and in a seat process
#: filereader's existing_predicate_arities/2 walks thirteen more predicates,
#: the door, its questions and the host services the binding now calls less the
