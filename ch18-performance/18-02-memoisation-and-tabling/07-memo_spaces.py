"""Purpose: examples/ch18-performance/18-02-memoisation-and-tabling/07-memo_spaces.metta in Python: a cache belongs to a space.

Each space compiles its own equations into its own module, so two spaces
defining the same name hold two functions, and each one caches on its own.
Sixteen claims watch that: the two answers stay apart, memoizing one leaves the
other's report false, and changing one space's equation moves only that space's
answer.

`evalc`'s Python image is the space handle itself, which is what makes this
file read: `metric.fn.shipping_cost(3)` evaluates IN &metric because the handle
carries the space, and the same call on `m` evaluates in &self. No form here
has to name a space at all, and the second space is created by ATOM,
`metta.space(S.metric)`, since a name is a symbol and never text.

The replacement equation goes to the container door. A second `@m.define` for a
name owned by a different Python function is refused with a named
`CompileError`; the write and read doors remove the old equation and put the
new one in without ceremony.

#: 629c86c, the library split, which moved every library's surface out of its
