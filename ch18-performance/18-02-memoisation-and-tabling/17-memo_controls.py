"""Purpose: examples/ch18-performance/18-02-memoisation-and-tabling/17-memo_controls.metta in Python: what lib_memo lets you ask and change.

`get-memoize-config` and the no-argument `get-memoize-stats` take NOTHING,
because what they describe is one global budget rather than a per-function
setting; the per-function question is the other arity of the same name.

WHAT THIS TWIN CANNOT SHOW is the counters' values, for the reason
`08-memo_stats.py` already records: a memoized function called from Python
does not reach lib_memo's dispatch hook, so two calls record a miss each where
two `!` forms in a file record one hit and one miss, and the per-function
entries stay at zero. Every claim below is one that holds either way -- the
answers, the shapes, and what each control DELETES -- and the counter
divergence is in the residue table with its reproduction.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.
