"""Purpose: examples/ch22-a-reasoner-you-can-serve/22-02-weighted-answers/18-pln_formulas.metta in Python: PLN's arithmetic, and the helpers it stands on.

PLN and NARS share several NAMES -- `Truth_Revision`, `Truth_Negation`,
`Truth_Abduction` -- and they are different functions with different arities,
so a program imports one library or the other and never both. Every name keeps
its underscore, so every one comes through the exact subscript door.

`/safe` answers NOTHING on a zero denominator rather than raising, which is
how a formula whose preconditions fail contributes no answer: an empty list
is that absence in Python.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.

#: withdrawing each through metta_remove_atom_reference/1, which uncompiles the
#: row's equation, so every import into an importing space pays that
