"""Purpose: examples/ch22-a-reasoner-you-can-serve/22-02-weighted-answers/17-nars_derivation_control.metta in Python: the priority queue under the reasoner.

A sentence is `(Sentence <term-and-truth> <stamp>)`, ordinary data, so every
argument here is a built atom. `BestCandidate` takes a ranking function by
NAME, which is why `S.PriorityRank` is a symbol rather than a Python callable:
passing the ranking in is what makes one fold serve both directions.
