#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-24, 353301 to 357076 (+3775), placed on the full-
#: configuration first-parent ladder from the pin commit 6e09cb25d: the 120
#: commits 43e964002..c09dc4868, where the per-commit probe sweep puts each
#: step at one commit: 5b4e7e53d reads a translator rule's declared type where
#: the rule lives; aea2e5e03 and 6922f54c9 carry the csv and lib_file refusal
#: vocabulary; d27805154 carries lib 19a231b, whose regenerated faces declare
#: six libraries' inputs %Undefined%, so their calls stop paying a declared-
#: type check (vector_lib -7278, statistics_lib -6453); 33219ffa0 resolves a
#: bare library name to its pkg.metta; 0cd329450 adds the platform refusal
#: kind, one metta_refusal_declaration/4 row that metta_catalog_preset/1 turns
#: into one more (refusal ...) catalog row and one more refusal-kind vocabulary
#: member, measured at +10 to +15 on most twins; and d8231f103 refuses a
#: library spec that walks out of the library root; a7955cd07 carried lib
#: 629c86c, the library split, which moved every library's surface out of its
#: pkg.metta manifest into lib.metta beside it, so an import reads the manifest
#: and then imports the library's own source as a second file; 54784fded reads
#: the builtin type surface from every .metta in lib_builtin_types' directory,
#: which restored the 195 builtin cost rows the split's manifest-only read had
#: dropped; 63b910f4f added a clause to metta_reference_internal/2 that asks
#: the specializer's ho_specialization/3 registry, so every reference grade a
#: load computes pays that lookup, which is how defined-name, documented and
#: undocumented stopped reporting specializer residues; 814b99468 retains a
#: self-call's function_view dependency, so a recursive body is rebuilt as a
#: caller of its own function whenever an arriving equation changes that view
#: (fib's rebuilds 1 to 2 and newtons_method's energy 2 to 4, each reached from
#: spaces:add_function_atom/7 through lib_memo's automatic reconcile), the fix
#: that took lib_statistics and lib_random to green; d6e09995c retires a load's
#: package rows from every space but its library home after package_load/3,
#: withdrawing each through metta_remove_atom_reference/1, which uncompiles the
#: row's equation, so every import into an importing space pays that
#: withdrawal; 6167a0fb2 makes import currency transitive: each nested load
#: records an import_nested_source/3 edge to every import still in flight above
#: it, and a cached import answers current only when every nested receipt does;
#: the 20 commits 6167a0fb2..864c4bac0, where the sweep puts the probes' only
#: step at e1acacad2, which clears a space's import bookkeeping from the module
#: that owns it; the commits 63fc952ac..8d45268e3, which the ladder did not
#: split; their runtime changes are 31c0afd8a (the host refusal's message),
#: 7472c4907, which marks a module's reference face dirty instead of walking
#: its forward closure, so support_stabilize/3 walks the face's dependents only
#: when the recomputed value moved and an event that changes nothing recompiles
#: no caller, 7054c11f7, which carries lib 62ca61c's bisecting bit length in
#: _support/statistics.metta, and the Python-seat pointers; da91bc244 confines
#: an exact removal's selection to its own atom: native_retract_one/2 now
#: records the selected clause's head, a clause/3 lookup per exact removal, and
#: checks each removal made while the selector is live against it, a few
#: inferences per removal (+8 on most twins, +24 to +192 on the library twins
#: that withdraw package rows); where a twin's move exceeds these steps, the
#: remainder is drift that stayed inside its band (four inferences, or its own
#: declared allowance) on every other interval [measured 2026-09-24: min-of-3
