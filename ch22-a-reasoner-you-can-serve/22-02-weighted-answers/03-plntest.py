"""Purpose: examples/ch22-a-reasoner-you-can-serve/22-02-weighted-answers/03-plntest.metta in Python: one PLN deduction, checked.

Two syllogistic premises go in, one conclusion comes out, and the truth value
on it is computed by the PLN deduction formula with its consistency
preconditions. The claim is that conclusion.

Five of the seven relations are compiled functions. Exact numeric annotations
let their Python operators preserve the source arithmetic heads. `clamp`
explicitly names the source's `min` and `max` relations, while the deduction
formula destructures its five truth values with Python's `match` statement,
which is MeTTa's `case`. Their declared arrows are the signatures' annotations.

Two are `@m.rules` bundles, the door for equations whose heads are structures
or symbols rather than parameter lists: `SyllogisticRuleGuard` and `STV` fix a
SYMBOL in the head, and `|-` destructures two premise pairs in its own. A rules
body EXECUTES, so its terms are built, which is why `if_` and `S.empty()`
appear there and Python's own `if` appears in the compiled bodies.

`Truth_Deduction` carries a genuine underscore, so the head is given
explicitly: the implicit name is the mechanical image and `truth-deduction`
would be a different head from the one the example makes matchable.

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-08, 40047 to 40041 (-6), the module boundary merged with
#: trunk's later packages (refactor/engine-and-libraries-as-modules at
#: b64291369): every space now resolves through one more chain link, prelude ->
#: metta_engine -> user, the engine's measured export list is imported into the
#: host tier at boot, the closed-sets watch point costs one inference per
#: &metta write, and a cursor opened by a host pays one transaction check at
#: its door; the branch pinned its budgets on its cut, trunk re-pinned the same
#: twins for the packages that landed after that cut, and only the merged tree
#: carries both, so this entry is where the two chains meet [measured

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-08, 39808 to 39861 (+53), The typed host door catalog is
#: published before user code. Its declarations change catalog lookup indexes;
#: generated public names bind directly to their existing bodies [measured

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-09, 39861 to 40079 (+218), the door table landed
#: (feat/space-as-a-projection-of-door-rows merged at 6471faa37, its
#: reconciliation fixes at 58bf75947): every Space door is a generated alias
#: over its body, the catalog publishes the door contracts at boot as typed
#: atoms, and the seam's listeners publish on every registration, so boot
#: content and clause layout moved, which shifts a twin count by tens; measured
#: on the merged tree [measured 2026-09-09: min-of-3 serial fresh processes;

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-09, 40079 to 40107 (+28), structured concurrency landed
#: (feat/structured-concurrency merged at f80cc416d): every space mint records
#: its allocation in the library's lifetime rows, every write and run pays the
#: ownership hook and every drop asks the library whether a scope owns the
#: name, measured on a pristine control as 32 per mint, 2 per write and 44 per
#: drop with none per read; measured on the merged tree [measured 2026-09-09:

BUDGET = 40107

#: DIVERGED 2026-09-07, the example holds 2 atoms the twin does not (2 =) and
#: the twin holds 8 the example does not (1 :, 2 =, 5 @doc): the twin is an
#: ordinary Python program and its body lowers to the engine's own forms: a
#: match statement is ONE equation whose body is a case tower where the example
#: writes one clause per arm, a named intermediate is a let* the original does
#: not have, a Python truth test wraps its condition in py-truthy, and the
#: annotations and docstrings that come with it are stored beside them
#: [measured 2026-09-07: the two stored-atom surpluses, one fresh process per
#: side; command=python extensions/python/tools/twin_coverage.py --repin;
