"""Purpose: examples/ch22-a-reasoner-you-can-serve/22-01-logic-programs/02-logicprogset.metta in Python: a set built by checking it.

`myf` says what a two-element set containing `a` and `b` is, and the example
then asks for one. Nothing constructs it: the first two conjuncts BIND `$M` by
membership and the third fixes its size, so the answer falls out of the search.

The clause is a `@m.rules` bundle because MeTTa's `and` is not Python's.
Python's `and` short-circuits on truthiness and lowers to a `let*`-then-`if`
chain; `(and (member a $M) (member b $M))` is a generate-and-test in which the
first conjunct binds for the second, and that binding IS the example. A rules
body EXECUTES, so `&` builds the conjunction term there, rung 3 of the descent
ladder, and `S.eq` builds the equality by its operator word.

The claim is `solve`, which is the relational `let`: the subject is evaluated,
its answer is unified with the pattern, and the subject's own variables come
back as bindings. That is what carries `$M` out, where an evaluation would
answer values.
