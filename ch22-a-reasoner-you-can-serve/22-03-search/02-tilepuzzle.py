"""Purpose: examples/ch22-a-reasoner-you-can-serve/22-03-search/02-tilepuzzle.metta in Python: the eight-tile state graph.

Twenty-four move equations say where the blank may go from each of the nine
positions, and a breadth-first loop walks the reachable states, refusing a
duplicate, until the queue empties. The claim is the count it reaches, 181441.

The moves are one shape repeated, so a pair of loops writes them: the blank's
position and the direction are the loop variables, and the row is the eight
placeholders with the blank swapped into place. The example writes all
twenty-four out; here the shape is stated once and `@m.rules` lands the
twenty-four equations the loops supply, which is the door for a head that
destructures a nine-cell board.

The search is a `@m.rules` bundle and two compiled functions. `bfs_loop` must
stay the example's TWO coexisting clauses, and that is measured rather than
assumed: folding them into one `if`/`else` compiles, answers correctly for a
few thousand states, and then raises StackOverflow at 16,665 of the 181,441,
because the recursive call moves out of the let* chain's tail position into
`if`'s third argument (friction, P14.4). The example inlines a `let*` under the
`collapse`, and the twin NAMES that intermediate as `fresh-neighbour` instead,
which is a compiled function whose statements ARE that let*.

Three names carry a genuine underscore, `bfs_loop`, `bfs_all` and `$_1`. The
factory attribute door maps every underscore to a hyphen, so the variables take
the bracket and the two heads are given explicitly with `name=`: the implicit
name would install `bfs-loop`, a different head from the one the example makes
matchable.
