"""Purpose: examples/ch08-data/08-03-the-shipped-libraries/02-datastructures_fingertree.metta in Python: the finger tree, walked.

The finger tree from lib_datastructures: O(1) at both ends, O(log n)
concatenation, one structure serving as sequence and deque at once. Fifteen
claims, every one of them about one of the eleven `ft-*` functions, so all
eleven are named.

Every claim nests the calls the way Python nests calls,
`push_front(1, push_back(3, push_front(2, ft_empty())))` through
`m.fn.ft_push_front` and its siblings. A call answers a lazy view, and a view
crossing into term position is an observation point: exactly one answer is
encoded, and zero or several refuse loudly, so a deterministic function
composes without any `.one()` between the levels. The one place `.one()` is
written is where a pop's single answer is UNPACKED into two Python names.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.

#: membership index, base-module type lookups and the singleton decoder landed
#: (perf/cross-engine-waivers merged): a Python decode with one named variable
#: builds no index and one with more builds it at the second distinct name,
