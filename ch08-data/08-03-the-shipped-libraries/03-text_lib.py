"""Purpose: examples/ch08-data/08-03-the-shipped-libraries/03-text_lib.metta in Python: lib_string and lib_file.

Guarantees: a short format argument list leaves later placeholders empty
[tested: python extensions/python/tools/twin_coverage.py examples/ch08-data/08-03-the-shipped-libraries/03-text_lib.metta;
commit=90ba93eb8f6e98ebfefc55416859bf13de6a8427].

Both libraries are the subject, so every function here is named through the
function namespace, where a typo raises on the line that writes it. What Python
takes over is the plumbing around them: the `let` chain that threads a file
handle through three calls is three statements, the file space is queried
through the handle's own subscript door, and every answer is compared as
ordinary Python data.

Two heads keep their MeTTa spelling with a stated reason rather than
dissolving. `format-args` is MeTTa HE's own formatter and this file is HE's
example of it, including what it does with too few arguments, which an f-string
cannot reproduce; `sort-strings` is the library function under test, not a
request to sort a Python list.

A trailing `!` has no Python image, so `write_file` and its siblings resolve to
`write-file!`: rung 4 of the descent ladder, applied at the function namespace.

The file this writes is named for the twin rather than for the example, so the
two can never meet on one path, and it is a `pathlib.Path` rather than text:
a path crosses the call door as the atom its codec makes of it.
