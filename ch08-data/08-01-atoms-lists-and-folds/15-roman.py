"""Purpose: examples/ch08-data/08-01-atoms-lists-and-folds/15-roman.metta in Python: lib_roman, walked end to end.

Every claim here is about a lib_roman function, so every one names it. Three
families: the higher-order maps and folds, the nine set operations whose names
are drawn from the shapes of their Venn diagrams, and the composition
combinators. Then the inverses: `let` unifying a CALL against a value so the
function runs BACKWARDS, where `(let (head $x) (1 2 3) $x)` answers 1 because
head, run in reverse, says what its argument's first element must be. `solve`
is the door for that shape, and its answer template takes the variables the
PATTERN introduces as well as the subject's, which is what this reading needs.

Six of the nine set operations carry VARIABLES in their arguments, and the
call answers the resulting term all the same. Two of those answers carry a
fresh variable, which is why they are compared with `alpha_eq` rather than
`==`: the engine renames variables and the claim is about the shape, not the
name.

An engine function may be named with an ampersand, and three of these are:
`&&&`, `&^&` and the Venn family's punctuation take the bracket, which is the
exact door for a name Python's grammar cannot spell. The arithmetic the maps
and folds are GIVEN takes the other door in the same ladder: `+` and `*` have
words, so `S.add(1)` is the partial application `(+ 1)` and `S.add` alone is
the operator mentioned by name.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.
