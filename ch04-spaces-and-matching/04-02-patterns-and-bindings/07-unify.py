"""Purpose: examples/ch04-spaces-and-matching/04-02-patterns-and-bindings/07-unify.metta in Python: the matching conditional.

`(unify a b then else)` runs the then branch once per binding set under which
a and b match, and the else branch exactly when no binding set exists. The
operands cross unevaluated, all four arguments are typed Atom, and only the
selected branch runs.

`metta.unify` carries both ruled acts. At two arguments it symmetrically
answers bindings over atoms Python already holds. At four arguments it
evaluates the engine conditional in expression position, and a compiled body
lowers the same call directly. A stored marker is asked for with `in`, which
IS match containment, and the space operand is the handle itself, because a
space is a grounded atom and no symbol names it.

Both marker probes are compiled definitions that write from inside their own
equations, over `(context-space)`, which is the space the equation runs in. A
third compiled definition calls four-argument `unify` directly so that the
compiler lowers the conditional rather than executing it while defining the
function. The markers stored are the example's own bare symbols. The Python
write door still refuses one, `m.add(S.then_ran)` answering "a stored atom is a
non-empty expression", where the engine's `add-atom` takes it; the two doors
disagreeing is filed as residue against P14.10.
