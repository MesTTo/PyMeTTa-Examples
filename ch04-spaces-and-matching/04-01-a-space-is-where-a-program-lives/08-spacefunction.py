"""Purpose: examples/ch04-spaces-and-matching/04-01-a-space-is-where-a-program-lives/08-spacefunction.metta in Python: removing a definition.

Two identical equations under different names, one of them removed. The removal
takes the compiled answer with it, so `(f 3 4)` becomes its own answer while
`(g 3 4)` still reduces to 7, and a plain fact behaves the same way.

That is the reflectivity invariant in Python dress: a Python-authored
definition is an ordinary atom, so `-=`, the operator that removes an atom,
removes it, and `equation(head).to(body)` names which atom to remove.
