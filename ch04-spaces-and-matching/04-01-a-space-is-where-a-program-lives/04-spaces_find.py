"""Purpose: examples/ch04-spaces-and-matching/04-01-a-space-is-where-a-program-lives/04-spaces_find.metta in Python: a match used as a condition.

lib_spaces' `find` asks whether a pattern matches AND binds what it matched, so
the original nests two of them and falls back twice: no continuation gives
`MissedSecondPiece`, no starting link at all would give `MissedAllPieces`.

A call keeps both faces. Iterating `find(...)` answers what the predicate
DECIDED, one `True` per solution or a single `False` when there is none, and
`.rows` answers the bindings it made, paired position for position. So `find`
is asked here exactly as the original asks it, the decision drives Python's own
`if` the way it drives the original's, and the bindings come off the row beside
it. The library's own name reaches the bound namespace once it is imported, so
the ask is `m.fn.find(...)` and nothing is spelled twice.

The library arrives through the write door, `m += lib.spaces`, because a
library IS knowledge and the receiver is the target space. The lib
namespace joins its `lib_` family prefix with underscores kept, which is
why no bracket spelling is needed for a name MeTTa writes as
`lib_spaces`.

#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 9493 to 9572, at the flat-door

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 9572 to 9573, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 9573 to 9575, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few

#: argument-walk fix this file's own chain named as the follow-up.
#: Planning a specialization grafts a call argument onto the equation's
