"""Purpose: examples/ch04-spaces-and-matching/04-01-a-space-is-where-a-program-lives/13-migrating_and_counting.metta in Python: counting without listing, and a filtered drain.

`match-count` folds `+` over a match answering 1 per solution, so nothing is
materialised; a Python `len()` over the answer list would materialise exactly
what the operation exists to avoid, so this twin calls the operation.

`migrateAtoms` is measured rather than trusted here, because what it does is
not what its name says: the shipped equation names the SOURCE space on both
sides and never reads its destination argument.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.
