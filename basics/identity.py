"""examples/basics/identity.metta in Python: square a number, check the answer.

The example defines `(= (f $x) (* $x $x))` and asserts `(f 1)` is 1. Here the
definition is an ordinary Python function the engine compiles, and the claim
is Python's own `assert`.

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire.
#: PLACEHOLDER for the twins wave: every budget in the corpus is 1 here and
#: the integrator's single re-pin pass prices them all on the merged tree, so
#: a figure measured in this worktree would price a tree that never ships
#: [assumed: unmeasured here, deliberately; commit=4df40a9de00bbc7fb9c55715a5d802512d6f7dc4].
#: INTERIM PIN 2026-08-23, min-of-3 on the wave-merged tree (2208 against the example's 2626): this file gates the pytest lane, so it is priced ahead of the corpus-wide pass that follows the library fixes, the guide update, and the marked-site sweep, and it is re-priced there with everything else.
