"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-01-if-and-booleans/10-and_then_or_else.metta in Python: short-circuiting.

`and-then` and `or-else` are the short-circuiting boolean connectives. They
are special forms rather than functions, which is the whole point: a
function's arguments are evaluated before the call, so a function could not
skip its second one.

Python's own `and` and `or` are those two forms exactly. Inside a compiled
body they lower to a binding plus a test that answers the DECIDING OPERAND,
so `a and b` is `(and-then $a $b)` down to which value comes back, and the
argument that is not chosen is never evaluated, because a compiled body's
arguments are syntax rather than calls.

They are not a second spelling of `and` and `or`. Those are RELATIONAL: they
evaluate both sides and can solve for an unbound argument. Python has no
relational `and`, so that one keeps MeTTa's name through the keyword builder
`and_`, and the last claim's `if` keeps its own through `if_`, whose two-arity
is the engine's and which Python's conditional expression cannot spell.

The original opens a second space to keep its two experiments apart. Python
keeps them apart with a slice of the context space, so `note2` records beside
`note` and the two equations really are the same equation twice, which is what
the original's two are once the space is factored out.

The write is the space container protocol inside a compiled body. Binding
`S.context_space()` to a local and applying `+=` lowers to `add-atom`, so the
equation stores its marker without a grounded host operation.
Guarantees:
  - TRUE and FALSE used here are package values rather than local
    reconstructions [tested: test_the_canonical_atoms_are_public_values;
