"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-03-let-and-sequencing/09-walrus.metta in Python: the walrus is let.

PEP 572's `:=` binds a name in the expression it stands in and leaves it
visible after, which is exactly what `let*` does around a continuation, so
the compiler hoists a walrus into the binding the source means: bound in a
return value here, bound in an if test there, read again in both. `//` is
the engine's own floor-div, so the halved value stays the integer the
source computes.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.
