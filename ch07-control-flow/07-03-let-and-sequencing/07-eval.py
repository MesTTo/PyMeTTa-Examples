"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-03-let-and-sequencing/07-eval.metta in Python: reading a body, then running it.

A `match` over the space answers a definition's BODY as data; it does not
interpret what it answers. Running the body is a second and separate act, and
in Python the two acts are two doors: the query door answers rows, and the
evaluation door takes the atom out of one and reduces it.

Both equations are compiled. `f` is an ordinary computation. `evalCustom`
writes to the running space from inside an equation. A space-bound local now
takes `+=` as `add-atom`, but `-=` deliberately means the one-occurrence
`subtract-atom`; the source asks for the draining `remove-atom`. Naming both
heads therefore keeps the pair parallel while preserving the source's exact
removal grain [tested: test_augmented_assignment_on_a_space_is_the_write_door,
test_remove_atom_drains_every_occurrence; commit=e3787593132a7ece2d300397045f7415709847c9].

The stored equations are deliberately not source-identical. Assignment
lowers `f`'s `let` to a one-binding `let*`. `evalCustom` lowers the source's
multi-binding `let*` to nested one-binding `let*` forms and names the running
space as `(context-space)` instead of the source token `&self`. The digest
lane reports both equations. `f`'s annotations also publish
`(: f (-> %Undefined% Number Number %Undefined%))`.
Guarantees:
  - every ordered atom assembled in this file passes one iterable to
    Expression [tested: test_expression_assembles_one_ordered_atom_from_an_iterable; commit=028b41a056cfd706e516cd0b945cbf69ac066da7]
