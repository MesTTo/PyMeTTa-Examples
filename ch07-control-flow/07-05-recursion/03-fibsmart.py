"""examples/ch07-control-flow/07-05-recursion/03-fibsmart.metta in Python: the accumulator fib.

Two equations by one decorator, and the second one shows how a compiled body
reaches a sibling whose MeTTa name is not its Python name. No Python
identifier carries a hyphen, so `def fib_tr` is installed as `fib-tr` by the
naming ladder's own underscore map, and nothing has to say that name twice.
`fib`'s body then CALLS the Python object, and the compiler emits the MeTTa
name that object was installed under, so the stored equation is the
original's.

The source stores `==`. Python's comparison compiles to the engine-native
`py-eq` head, so `fib-tr` deliberately differs in that one stored spelling.
The digest lane reports it.

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire.
#: PLACEHOLDER for the twins wave: every budget in the corpus is 1 here and
#: the integrator's single re-pin pass prices them all on the merged tree, so
#: a figure measured in this worktree would price a tree that never ships
#: [assumed: unmeasured here, deliberately; commit=d4e4f9cf0500c00c8f1201a60cbcf54de7c3fa84].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 13288 to 13307, at the flat-door
#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (metta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9
#: residue retirement), and an import-bearing twin now spells
#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 13307 to 13320, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 13320 to 13252, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 13252 to 13262, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the whole corpus re-pins once on the exact release tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 after a canonical single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 13262 to 13315 (+53), by the open-tail-index
#: pricing pass, one sweep over the whole corpus after four attributed
#: engine movements: the writable-specialization merge 5c731b03 prices
#: each lazily translated match-bearing equation (~+1,500, first-call
#: probe 2,208 to 3,724 across that merge alone;
#: ai-brief-p14-specializer-translation-tax names the follow-up), the
#: relational-candidate rows of 6917bef7, and the open-tail head-index
#: and deprecation apply-seam fixes recovering their shares; the
#: remainder is compiled-image layout, the class this file's own chain
#: documents [measured: min-of-3 serial fresh processes; command=python bindings/python/tools/twin_coverage.py --measure --rounds 3; fixture=p14-integration open-tail-index pricing tree with engine/reader.so; commit=5ca9ef775933e349f8dc3ec64ec3cb85273a5a00].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 13315 to 13335 (+20), on the composed
#: async-scheduler tree: a live operation call pays the six-inference
#: admission probe the baseline's p14_async_scheduler_comment prices,
#: and the scheduler, context-callback and exact-memo lifecycle clauses
#: move compiled-image layout by tens, the class this file's chain
