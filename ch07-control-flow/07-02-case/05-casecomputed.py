"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-02-case/05-casecomputed.metta in Python: cases as a value.

The cases of a `case` are usually written out, and then they are syntax: the
form compiles one nested conditional out of them once. They do not have to be
written out. A cases argument that arrives as a VALUE is compiled when it
arrives, so the branches can be decided while the program runs, and that is
what lets `case` be given another name as an ordinary definition.

`case` over branches a program computes is the one shape Python has no word
for at all, and the reason survives the lowering that landed: Python's `match`
IS a `case` and compiles as one, but its arms are SYNTAX, so no Python
spelling takes them as an argument. Written-out cases are stated beside
handed-over ones here on purpose, so writing half of them as `match`
statements would compare a Python construct with a MeTTa value and break the
very pairing the file exists to show.

Two things do move into Python. `cons-atom` onto a tail is writing the
expression, so `numbered-cases` says the pair list it builds; and a refusal
crosses the seam as a Python exception, so `catch` is `except` and the branch
that reads what came back is Python's own.
