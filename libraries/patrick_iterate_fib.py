"""Purpose: examples/libraries/patrick_iterate_fib.metta in Python: fib by iteration, not recursion.

`iterate` runs a step function n times over a carried state, so the hundredth
Fibonacci number costs a hundred steps rather than a tree of calls. `iterate`
and `first` are lib_patrick's own, and a compiled body says them through the
STATIC `fn` namespace, which is what a body reads for a function it did not
define; the step it PASSES is data, so it takes the `S` door.

`fib-step` stays at the container door, and that is the residue entry this file
carries: its head destructures its second argument, `(fib-step $i ($a $b))`,
where a decorated function's parameters are always plain variables.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.

#: A PLACEHOLDER, not a measurement. The twins wave re-authored this file and
#: the integrator prices every budget in one pass on the merged tree, so a
#: figure measured here would pin a tree that does not ship
#: [assumed: this twin's inference cost is unmeasured on this branch;
#: commit=1e264c186c531e69acde5ad03ff6a79210626df4].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 43180 to 43218, at the flat-door
#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (petta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9
#: residue retirement), and an import-bearing twin now spells
#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 43218 to 43160, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 43160 to 43129, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 43129 to 43118, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the whole corpus re-pins once on the exact release tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 after a canonical single-boot QLF regeneration].
