"""Purpose: examples/ch19-spaces-backed-by-anything/19-01-spaces-of-your-own/02-restricted_spaces.metta in Python: a curated execution base.

A restricted space keeps ordinary computation and its own equations, refuses
anything its base does not publish, and gains a capability only when the
capability is granted at creation.

`metta.space(S.locked, restricted=True)` and
`metta.space(S.reader, restricted=True, grants=[SpaceCapability.file])` are
those two spaces, named exactly as `!(new-space &locked (restricted))` and
`!(new-space &reader (restricted (grants file)))` name them. A name and a MODEL
are independent.

A path crosses as the `pathlib.Path` it is and a capability as the vocabulary
value it is, so neither is quoted into text.
