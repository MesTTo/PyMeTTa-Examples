"""Purpose: examples/ch05-equations-and-evaluation/05-01-an-equation-is-a-rewrite/06-functionhead.metta in Python: an argument constrained to be a call's OUTPUT.

An equation HEAD cannot carry the constraint, because a head is a pattern and
a pattern is matched structurally at every depth: `(= (h (myfunc (10) $B) $C)
...)` asks for a first argument that IS the three-element expression, not for
one the call can produce. So the constraint goes in the BODY, where the
argument is unified with what the call produces, the call runs backwards, and
`$B` comes out bound.

All three definitions are ordinary Python functions. What makes that possible
is the mention doors a compiled body now has: `V.b` MINTS the hole the
backwards call fills, a variable no parameter supplies; `fn.append` and
`fn["="]` name engine functions whose spellings Python's grammar will not take
as bare identifiers; and `S.let` names the relational `let` itself, which has
no Python statement, because assignment is `let` in the OTHER direction, where
the pattern is a fresh name and the subject is the call.

`h_old` tests with `=`, MeTTa's unification, and `fn["="]` is the function
namespace's exact spelling for that head; the newer `h` says the same thing
with the inversion door.
Guarantees:
  - every ordered atom assembled in this file passes one iterable to
    Expression [tested: test_expression_assembles_one_ordered_atom_from_an_iterable;

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire.
#: PLACEHOLDER for the twins wave: every budget in the corpus is 1 here and
#: the integrator's single re-pin pass prices them all on the merged tree, so
#: a figure measured in this worktree would price a tree that never ships
#: [assumed: unmeasured here, deliberately; commit=d4e4f9cf0500c00c8f1201a60cbcf54de7c3fa84].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 20764 to 20804, at the flat-door

#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (metta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9

#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 20804 to 20810, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 20810 to 20779, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and

#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
