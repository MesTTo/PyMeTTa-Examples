"""examples/ch05-equations-and-evaluation/05-01-an-equation-is-a-rewrite/02-twostage.metta in Python: a call before its callee exists.

Three nullary equations, and the order they are written in is the subject. `f`
is stored before `g`, so its body names something the engine does not yet know;
`h` is stored after, so its body names a function. Both answer 42, which is the
two-stage claim: a call compiled against a name that is only data at the time
is re-dispatched once the name becomes a function.

Python spells that difference with the two doors the guide already has for it.
Calling the SYMBOL, `S.g()`, mentions a head and builds `(g)`, which is what
you write for a name nothing has defined; calling the Python name, `g()`, is an
application of a function that exists. The compiler says the same thing from
the other side, refusing an unknown callee and naming `S.g` as the remedy.

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire. PLACEHOLDER rather than a

#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 8800 to 8833, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 8833 to 8759, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying

#: ENVELOPED 2026-08-25 by the observe pass: this twin's count is
#: intrinsically multi-valued (allocation-timing jitter moves GC
#: work between runs; ten serial runs of one such twin answered six
#: distinct counts), so a point pin with the +-4 tolerance is a
#: false claim here. Bounds are the exact extrema of 10
#: full-lane observations under 'full-lane/218/workers=32'; a cost outside them
#: is a real finding, and a new mode discovered later extends the
