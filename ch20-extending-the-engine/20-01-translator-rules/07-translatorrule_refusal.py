"""Purpose: examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-01-translator-rules/07-translatorrule_refusal.metta in Python: a rule with reasons.

A rule head says WHICH shape it rewrites. A guard inside the rule says whether
the match it got is one the rewrite can honour, which is a different question
and needs a different answer: `(refuse Reason)`. A refusal is a decline rather
than an error, so the call carries on down the dispatch chain and the next
equation gets its turn, and the words the rule gave are published where a
program can read them.

Both equations select on STRUCTURE, `(dose $n)` and `(unit mg)`, and both must
coexist in the order the rule tries them, which is the pair `@m.rules` exists
for. A bundle body EXECUTES, so its comparison is built by the word door,
`S.gt(n, 1000)`, where a lowered body would write `n > 1000`; the arithmetic
builds either way, so `n / 1000` there is the term `(/ $n 1000)`.

Which is why the last claim is an ordinary query: the reason lands in the
reflection space as a fact, so asking why a rewrite did not happen is
`reflection[pattern]` like any other question.
