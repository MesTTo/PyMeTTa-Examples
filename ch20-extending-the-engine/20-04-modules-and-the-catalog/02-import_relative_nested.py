"""examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-04-modules-and-the-catalog/02-import_relative_nested.metta in Python: one import, two files deep.

`root.metta` imports a sibling and a file in a subdirectory, and both of those
imports resolve against the FILE that wrote them rather than against the
process. Importing `root` alone therefore has to bring in all three, which is
what the two claims check.

The path is written from the repository root because a Python program has no
importing file to resolve against, which is the friction this file carries. The
space is the handle itself, which crosses into the built term as a grounded
operand.

#: Inferences this twin spends, its own tripwire. PLACEHOLDER rather than a

#: the merge moves [assumed 2026-08-24: unpriced placeholder, re-pinned by the
#: integrator; commit=e70eaeba6b6c0afc9081239041b8459eb8bb1b92].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.

#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (metta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9

#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 7265 to 7266, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 7266 to 7272, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-26, 7272 to 7285 (+13), by the open-tail-index
