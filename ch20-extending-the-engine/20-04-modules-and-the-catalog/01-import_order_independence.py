"""Purpose: examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-04-modules-and-the-catalog/01-import_order_independence.metta in Python: a callee that arrives second.

The index the example imports loads a file that USES a function before it loads
the file that DEFINES it, and then calls the result. So the one claim is that
an import may be written before the import it depends on, and the caller still
answers.

The import is the write door with the receiver as the target space,
`m += lib(INDEX)`, the path crossing through the lib namespace's
exact-module-form call door.

#: change and 7859 with the change (+18): every operation that registers a name
#: outside a load opens a registration unit, files there the repairs its
#: registrations owe, and drains them once when it finishes, so a caller
#: compiled before the name became a function is repaired: with that use this

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-29, 7859 to 7854 (-5), this twin reads 7859 before the
#: change and 7854 with the change (-5): a call site forces the function it
#: names before deciding the call's shape, so a call of a waiting function
#: builds the application protocol an eager load builds, and the protocol's
#: marker test around a value the translation already holds is decided at
#: compile time: with that use this twin reads 7854 where the definitions alone

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-30, 7854 to 7834 (-20), this twin reads 7854 before the
#: change and 7834 with the change (-20): a named space's prelude-tier type
#: readers look the prelude's row up before asking whether it governs there,
#: and builtin_result_type/3 asks whether a program took a builtin over only
#: for a builtin whose result is evaluated (engine/metta/types.pl,
#: engine/translator/lowering.pl), so a lookup of a name the prelude does not
#: declare costs one indexed miss and no ownership probe [measured

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-30, 7834 to 7896 (+62), the twins lane reads this twin at
#: 7838 before this change and at 7896 with it (+58): every import request that
#: succeeds, a load or a receipt still current, now records who asked for the
#: source (engine/metta/interop.pl, record_import_request/2 writing
#: import_request/3), so unimport! of a package can leave a file another live
#: requester still asks for; it read 7838 against its pin 7834 before this
#: change, +4 from an earlier commit of this landing, the takeover read through
#: a module's compiled predicate, inside the allowance [measured
