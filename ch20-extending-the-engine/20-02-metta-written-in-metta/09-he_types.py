"""Purpose: examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-02-metta-written-in-metta/09-he_types.metta in Python: the type judgment, asked directly.

The import shadows prelude heads with upstream lib_he's equations. Its
`match-types` compares by exact equality. `type-cast` remains a prelude head
and an undeclared type fails that equality; `is-function`, the pair accessors
and `match-type-or` are the other judgments this file calls.

The arrow it observes is built by `arrow(...)`, the `->` form as DATA, which is
the same character Python writes in a signature and the builder the surface
keeps for the rare case where the arrow itself has to be handed to something.
A declaration is `typed(a, T)`, the `(: a T)` form as data.

`type-cast` takes the space it asks as an ARGUMENT, and a space crosses a term
position as a grounded operand, so the receiver is handed over rather than
named.

`type-cast` is asked as an engine head so its refusal remains observable as
an error atom. `%Undefined%` does not equal a requested declared type.

The refusal is an Error ATOM, and iterating the answer view keeps it as data
where the scalar doors take the loud reading and raise.
