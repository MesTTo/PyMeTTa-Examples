"""Purpose: examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-06-files-and-processes/05-seeking-and-sizing.metta in Python: moving the cursor, and measuring the file.

`file-get-size!` answers the size of the FILE rather than of what is left, so
it does not move or consult the cursor; `file-seek!` moves the cursor, which
makes a handle a random-access read rather than a stream.

Each claim opens its own handle and removes its own file, so nothing here
outlives the run.
Open Obligations:
  To Do: None
  Hacks: None
  Future Enhancements: None.
